I believe everyone has their own type of 'weird' in their life, but like in the best way. I'm on a mission to document that weird. To show you how beautiful your love story is when you're being yourselves. To guide you towards planning your day for YOU and to be that calming presence you didn't know you needed on your big day. I've shot over 90 weddings meaning I have the experience under my belt to put your mind at ease. I can tactfully tell mom she might be stressing you out. I can confidently walk into any lighting scenario and give you creative portraits. Most importantly, I've learned the photos people cherish the most, are the ones that aren't on the shot list. And that my friends, is why I am a Documentary Style Wedding Photographer.",
